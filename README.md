# Shibboleth IdP Version 5 Installer

## Overview
The AAF Shibboleth IdP Installer is designed to automate the install of version 5 for the [Shibboleth IdP](https://shibboleth.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDP5/overview) on a dedicated server with one of the following supported operating systems;
* Rocky Linux
* Stream
* Redhat
* ORACLE Linux
* Ubuntu

For a full set of documentation and guidance on upgrading from Shibboleth version 4 please refer to the [AAF IdPv4 Installer Knowledge base](https://support.aaf.edu.au/support/solutions/articles/19000159910-shibboleth-idp-version-5-installer).

# Shibboleth IdP Version 5 Installer

### Actions undertaken during installation
The installation process will:

Optionally perform a yum -y update (system wide package upgrade). Please note that the installer uses yum or apt-get for the installation of all system components (except Jetty and Shibboleth IdP).

* Install all required dependencies (git, ansible, mariadb etc). With the previous step in mind, bootstrap will always use the latest versions of these packages.
* Create self signed keys for Jetty. These are for initial testing of the IdP and are replaced when further customising the Shibboleth IdP
* Install Jetty with Shibboleth IdP. Jetty runs on port 443 and optionally ports 80 and 8443 and creates the Shibboleth IdP web app context /idp.
* Install a MariaDB instance. A database is created (name: idp_db, user: idp_admin) with these schemas populated.
* Installs chrony for time synchronisation.
* Opens local firewall ports 443 and optionally ports 80 and 8443
* Optionally configures the IdP for integration with eduGAIN
* Optionally configures the IdP to enable various REFEDS specifications.

Hereâ€™s a complete guide to resolving the Python interpreter issue with Ansible by creating a new `ansible.cfg` file:

---

### Open terminal as a root (Linux Server). 

Run the following command:

```bash
sudo -s
```

Enter the root password.

---

### Grab the latest packages
Update and Upgrade the database of available packages:
```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```

---

### Ensure `Python` is Installed
First, confirm that Python 3 is installed. If it's not, install it with the following commands:

```bash
apt install python3
```

---

### Change TimeZone w.r.t to your country:
```bash
timedatectl set-timezone Asia/Karachi 
```

---

### Set the IdP hostname, The public domain name of the IdP may be used in determined the entityID of the IdP.

(ATTENTION: Replace `idp.example.org` with your IdP Full Qualified `Domain Name` and `<HOSTNAME>` with the IdP hostname)

```bash
vim /etc/hosts
```

`<YOUR SERVER IP ADDRESS> idp.example.org <HOSTNAME>`
`hostnamectl set-hostname <HOSTNAME>`

---

### Installing `Ansible`
install Ansible run these commands

```bash
apt update
```
```bash
apt install ansible
```

---

## Event Logging

The installer provides detailed information on each step undertaken during the setup process. If the installation completes successfully, this output can be disregarded. However, for future reference, all installer output is logged to:

```
/opt/shibboleth-idp5-installer/activity.log
```

## Preparing the `bootstrap-v5.ini` File

1. **Download `bootstrap-v5.ini`:**

   For new installations, download the `bootstrap-v5.ini` file with the following command:

   ```bash
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/talha433/customized-shibboleth-idp5-installer/main/bootstrap-v5.ini > bootstrap-v5.ini
   ```

2. **Edit `bootstrap-v5.ini`:**

   Open and configure the file using a text editor, for example:

   ```bash
   vi bootstrap-v5.ini
   ```

3. **Configure Required Sections:**

Press `i` to enter Insert Mode. Now you can type and edit the file.

   - **[main]**: Review, configure, and uncomment each field in this section.
   - **[ldap]**: If using LDAP, configure the settings here. TLS configuration can be updated post-bootstrap if needed.
   - **[logging, policy, and advanced]**: Carefully review and adjust settings as required, understanding the impact of each change.

Click the `Esc` key and then type `:wq!` to save and exit the configuration.

## Running the Installer

1. **Download and Prepare `bootstrap-v5.sh`:**

   Execute the following command to download and make the installer executable:

   ```bash
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/talha433/customized-shibboleth-idp5-installer/main/bootstrap-v5.sh > bootstrap-v5.sh && chmod u+x bootstrap-v5.sh
   ```

   Ensure `bootstrap-v5.ini` is in the same directory as `bootstrap-v5.sh`.

2. **Run the Installer as Root:**

   Execute the installer script as the root user:

   ```bash
   ./bootstrap-v5.sh
   ```

This process will install and configure the server to operate as a Shibboleth Identity Provider (IdP).

---

## Allowing the installer to run again
In general you will never need to re-run the bootstrap-v5.sh script after it has completed creating the `/opt/shibboleth-v5-installer` directory. You should use the deploy or upgrade scripts instead.

If you must re-run bootstrap-v5.sh then you remove the lock file first. Note this will overwrite any previous installations.

```bash
rm /root/.lock-idp-bootstrap-v5 && ./bootstrap-v5.sh
```

The bootstrap-v5 process will now start over and attempt to install and configure your server to operate as a Shibboleth IdP.
